Tables involved: The question likely involves tables related to cards, their illustrations, and possibly languages or translations. Specifically, we might need tables such as \"Cards\", \"Illustrations\", and possibly \"Languages\" or \"Translations\".\n            \n            2. Relevant columns: The columns of interest would include those that indicate whether a card is borderless, the language of the illustration (in this case, Russian), and possibly a column to count or identify unique cards or illustrations.\n            \n            3. Operations needed: To find the number of borderless cards illustrated in Russian, we would need to filter the data to include only cards that are borderless and have illustrations in Russian. This involves filtering based on conditions (borderless = true, language = Russian). After filtering, we would need to count the number of unique cards that meet these criteria",

    "understanding": " \n            The user is asking for the number of cards that have a toughness of 99. This query is likely to involve the \"Cards\" table, as it contains information about individual cards. The relevant column in this case would be the \"toughness\" column, which stores the toughness value of each card.\n            \n            To answer this question, a filtering operation would be needed to select only the cards with a toughness of 99. This could be achieved through a WHERE clause in SQL, specifying the condition that the toughness should be equal to 99.\n            \n            An aggregation operation, specifically a COUNT, would also be required to determine the total number of cards that meet the specified condition. This would give the user the total count of cards with a toughness of 99.\n            \n            There are no apparent ambiguities in the question, as it clearly specifies the condition (toughness of 99) and the desired outcome (the number of cards).
