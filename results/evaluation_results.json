This will allow us to link each molecule to its corresponding atoms.\n            \n            ## Step 3: Select the relevant columns\n            We need to select the label column from the molecule table and the element column from the atom table.\n            \n            ## Step 4: Apply the conditions\n            We need to apply two conditions:\n            1. The molecule must be of type 'carcinogenic'.\n            2. The molecule must not contain fluorine.\n            \n            To check if a molecule contains fluorine, we can use"
