# MAC-SQL Project Summary

## Project Overview

The MAC-SQL project implements a sophisticated text-to-SQL agent using Memory, Attention, and Composition techniques. The agent is built with LangChain and Together AI models, providing a powerful solution for translating natural language questions into SQL queries.

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Project Restructuring**
   - Organized the codebase into a clean, maintainable structure
   - Created a backup directory for legacy files
   - Established a results directory for evaluation outputs
   - Developed a unified run.py script for easy execution

2. **Environment Setup**
   - Created and configured a Python virtual environment
   - Resolved dependency issues, particularly with NumPy and Python 3.12
   - Updated requirements.txt with compatible package versions

3. **Code Improvements**
   - Updated import paths to match the latest LangChain API
   - Removed deprecated parameters from model initialization
   - Fixed SQL dialect adaptation for PostgreSQL compatibility
   - Enhanced the evaluation script for better benchmark testing

4. **Documentation**
   - Updated README with clear setup and usage instructions
   - Added detailed project structure information
   - Documented technical details of the MAC architecture
   - Provided examples for running the UI and evaluation

## Project Structure

The final project structure is clean and well-organized:

```
.
├── mac_sql_agent.py     # Main agent implementation
├── evaluate.py          # Evaluation script for benchmarks
├── run.py               # Convenience script for running the project
├── requirements.txt     # Project dependencies
├── int.py               # PostgreSQL configuration
├── results/             # Evaluation results
├── dev_20240627/        # Mini-bird benchmark dataset
└── backup/              # Legacy files (for reference)
```

## Usage

The project now offers a streamlined experience:

1. **Setup**: Create a virtual environment and install dependencies
2. **UI**: Run the Streamlit interface with `python run.py --ui`
3. **Evaluation**: Test on benchmarks with `python run.py --evaluate --db [database_names]`

## Technical Implementation

The MAC-SQL agent implements:

1. **Memory**: Conversation buffer for context tracking
2. **Attention**: Schema-based retrieval for focusing on relevant database information
3. **Composition**: Multi-step SQL generation process

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for enhancement:

1. Add more visualization options for evaluation results
2. Implement additional SQL dialect adapters
3. Optimize retrieval for larger database schemas
4. Add support for more LLM providers beyond Together AI
